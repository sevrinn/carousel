# Image Carousel
Built this image carousel from scratch with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.

This one was fun. I learned about iterating an array with the ES6 FOR OF loop instead of a basic FOR loop. 
The javascript logic for rotating through a array of images made a lot more sense to my human brain with the FOR OF loop.
I also was able to utilize CSS keyframes to create some animations on so the transition from one slide to the next looks smoother.
